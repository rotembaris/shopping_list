# The Shopping List Bot Hackathon 
> An intro to python exercise

This project is our way to run an small hackathon to our friend who want to learn some basic skills in programming. In this hackathon, we don't assume you have a previous knowledge and we explain all you need to start in a fun way and action-packed way, no long boring lectures, just hands-on experience.

Together we will create shopping list telegram bot. The main goal is to learn some basic Python and coding skills. On the way you will setup your development environment and learn a bit how to use Git and GitHub.

## Where to start? (Agenda)

To get started, you need to follow the [Installation and Configuration Guide](doc/installation-guide.md). This guide will walk you through the steps to set up your development environment.

After you have completed the installation, you will start with a [Warming Up Exercise](doc/warming-up-exercise.md) to get you familiar with basic Python programming and some Git commands.

Now come the real fun part. Together we will step-by-step create the [Shopping List Bot](doc/shopping-list-bot.md). Along the way you will learn more Python and programming concept and skills.

**[Experimental Feature ðŸ¤”]** On the end of the hackathon, you will fork/upload the [Shopping List Bot repository]() to your own github account and finally will have your own shopping list bot that you can use and share with your friends.

Have fun! ðŸ¤—
